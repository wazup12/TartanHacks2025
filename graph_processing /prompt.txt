Mega prompt     

Hey, I am working on a project and I need your help. 

I am trying to build a project that allows me to model and visualize a fire as itâ€™s spreading through a city or a certain area. 

What I have already: 
I have a bunch of python scripts: 
- one script takes a pair of coordinates as input, and then, in around 60 seconds produces all roads, all intersections and a graph of all roads and all intersections within a given area. 
    the output of this is a massive graph of a few thousand vertices (corresponding to the intersections) and a few thousand edges (corresponding to the roads) which are all weighted depending on how fire prone they 
    are

The first step of what I want to do is to have a web ui which displays a map at a certain coordinate and scale that I can input, preferably, this map would be open street map as this is the map that I used for all
of my road pre-processing. I want the ui to be one large map, I want the user to be able put in some coordinates, and then I want the map to move to those coordinates on the front end, and then I want to run the
python script on the backend, centered on those coordinates. While the python script is running I want some sort of loading bar on the ui to just tell the user that they have to wait, actually it doesn't even have to
be a loading bar, it just needs to be some indication that the script is running. Then, once the python script is done running I want to overlay the graph that it found onto the map so that I can do further visualization.

I am doing this for a hackathon project so I need whatever solution you give me to this to be quite simple and fast to implement. I am not super experienced so I would appreciate your help in setting up this web ui 
and making sure that everything works correctly. Please try to use as few dependencies as possible and make it simple. 

Alright, with all that in mind. Please give me tech stack suggestions and give me instructions on how to get started. Thanks :)
